Ticket: AGT-263
Title: [AUTO] Agent retry with exponential backoff
Priority: high
Status: backlog

Description:
## Goal

When Claude fails (rate limit, error), retry with backoff instead of failing immediately.

## Current

Agent retries 3x with fixed 2s/4s delay.

## Improvement

* Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s
* Max 5 retries
* Log each retry to Convex

## North Star

Resilient automation - temporary failures don't stop progress.

=== DISPATCH RULES ===
- Commit with "closes AGT-263" when done
- Push immediately after commit
- Leave Linear comment: files changed, what was done
